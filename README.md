Writing Good code, Refactoring & The MVC Pattern.

Asynchronous Error handling (Lecture: 530):
There is a problem with Express.js related to errors caused by asynchronous operations. Those
don't reach the default error handling middleware. Therefore, whenever you working with
asynchronous code and with asynchronous operations, you have to write your own error handling
and force Express to trigger its error-handling middleware.

For e.x:
The ObjectId constructor throws an error if it receives an id that does't follow mongodb id format. Normally when code throws an error, the default error-handler become active.
But ObjectId constructor used in post.js model is in an async function - getSinglePost.
That means all the code inside of this function is wrapped into a promise and this overall is
an asynchrous operation. unfortunately, errors generated by or inside of such async operations
are not handled by the express error-handling middleware.

Instead we have to manually handle the error first and then call `next` and forward the error to default error-handling middleware.
